	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>Hello! My name is Skittle, and I am 18 years old. I’m currently studying Applied Informatics at the University of Pavol Jozef Šafárik in Košice, Slovakia. My passion for programming started at a young age, and over the years, it has grown into something that shapes both my academic and personal life.

I am deeply interested in various aspects of computer science, ranging from software development to data analysis and everything in between. My academic focus in Applied Informatics allows me to gain both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, which I believe are essential for making a meaningful impact in the tech industry.

Outside of my university studies, I am always looking for new projects to work on. Whether it’s developing small applications, contributing to open-source software, or building personal websites, I enjoy creating things that solve real-world problems. My goal is to continue improving my coding skills, experiment with new technologies, and eventually pursue a career in software engineering or IT development.

In addition to programming, I enjoy exploring different areas of technology, including web development, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. I love how these fields are constantly evolving and presenting new challenges. I believe that being curious and open to learning is key to staying relevant in such a fast-paced industry.

This website is a place where I showcase my projects, share my learning experiences, and document my journey as I grow as a programmer. I hope that my work can inspire others, and I’m always excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you want to discuss ideas, collaborate, or just chat about technology. I am always open to learning from others and building connections in the tech community.</p>
